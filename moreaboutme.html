									<h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
									<p>Below is a more personal discussion about what I like to do it my spare time.<br /><br />
									<strong>Scroll down to read about my interests.</strong><br /></p>
									<h3>Home DIY</h3>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/garage.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>As far back as I can remember, I have always enjoyed painting, building, woodworking, and any other type of construction. I find joy in working with my hands as I think it uses a different part of the brain and requires a different style of thinking and for me, it becomes a nice break from academic work. Over the last two years, I’ve resealed bathrooms, fixed leaks, and plastered and painted anything that needed it in my house. My biggest accomplishment was fixing a leak in my garage, sealing and painting the space, and converting it into a home gym.
									</p><p>This process took about two months, and even more preparation time before that to figure out how to stop the leak. Once I found it, I had to tackle the porous concrete bricks that expelled dust. This dust made the space unsafe to use as a gym, so I brushed it down as much as I could, painted it with a strong sealant, and then painted over it again with a bright colour to help with light in the space. Lastly, I painted the floor in an attempt to make the space look cleaner. When I finished, I felt a massive sense of achievement, and I now enjoy stepping away from studying at my desk to exercise.			
									</p>
								<p>Having been so busy with college, I haven’t been able to keep on top of anything that needs to be fixed at home. When I finish final year, I look forward to getting back at it!
									<br /><br /></p>

								<header class="major">
									<h3>Golf</h3>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/golf.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Growing up, I was always interested in sports and enjoyed playing as much as I could. I’ve played soccer, tennis, rugby, basketball, and most recently I’ve taken up golf. During COVID-19, the sports I was playing were all cancelled and I felt like I had nothing to do. The local pitch and putt golf course in the park next to my house opened up before anything else and I decided to go up and start playing. 
									</p><p>I found the game much more challenging than I expected and realised there was a lot more to it than just swinging the club. As I continued to play I got better, and I joined Balcarrick Golf Club with friends when the pandemic ended and still play to this day. I find that there is a huge analytical side to golf that people who don’t play may not realise. Taking into account lie angles, wind, break on the greens, distances, and clubs, there is a massive amount of thinking to the game and analysing your surroundings.			
									</p>
								<p>Some of the driving ranges now have TrackMan technology equipped, which is fascinating for anyone interested in analytics. The technology uses sensors to read your swing and shot of the ball and provides you with insights into where you can improve. I’m looking forward to good weather in the summer so I can continue to play.</p>
